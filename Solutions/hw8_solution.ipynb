    "## 2. Heat pipe design\n",
    "\n",
    "A heated fluid at temperature $T$ (degrees above ambient temperature) flows in a pipe with fixed length and circular cross section with radius $r$. A layer of insulation, with thickness $w$, surrounds the pipe to reduce heat loss through the pipe walls ($w$ is much smaller than $r$). The design variables in this problem are $T$, $r$, and $w$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The energy cost due to heat loss is roughly equal to $\\alpha_1 Tr/w$. The cost of the pipe, which has a fixed wall thickness, is approximately proportional to the total material, i.e., it is given by $\\alpha_2 r$. The cost of the insulation is also approximately proportional to the total insulation material, i.e., roughly $\\alpha_3 r w$. The total cost is the sum of these three costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The heat flow down the pipe is entirely due to the flow of the fluid, which has a fixed\n",
    "velocity, i.e., it is given by $\\alpha_4 Tr^2$. The constants $\\alpha_i$ are all positive, as are the variables $T$, $r$, and $w$.\n",
